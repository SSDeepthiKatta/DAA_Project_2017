   **PROJECT APPROACH**   
   
Emergency Vehicle Dispatch is the class project implemented under the guidance of Dr.Kuhail to submit for the grading of the course CS 5592(Design Analysis and Algorithms).    

Language Used: JAVA   

Software: ECLIPSE version JE-Oxygen2  

Operating System: Windows, iOS   
    
  **Project Briefing:**   
  
•	The project mainly aims to dispatch a emergency vehicle to the desired location inserted.   

•	The vehicle types given are 1. Ambulance(A) 2. Fire Truck(F)and 3. Police Car(P)  

•	For the input like Vehicle ID, Vehicle Type and the Distance between the zip codes are manually inserted and are stored in JTables.   

•	 By taking the current location, minimum distance between the zip codes in the locality are calculated.    

•	For calculating the minimum distance between the zip codes, famous Dijkstra’s algorithm is used and the values are displayed in console.    

•	Availability of the desired vehicle is searched, and the minimum distance zip codes location dispatches the emergency vehicle.   

**WORK FLOW**   

The Following steps are implemented in the project.   

Step 1. Creating Tables.    
Step 2. Inserting the current zip code.     
Step 3. Finding Shortest Paths.    
Step 4. Availability Check    
Step 5. Dispatch Vehicle Allocation.
